Designed and developed from scratch using just `React` and `Styled Components`. It's highly responsive thanks to `flexbox` and media queries using 6 breakpoints.

This was built as my practice project in 2019 and is **very** out-of-date; it uses Javascript and React class components ðŸ¤®.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Docker Desktop installed and running on your machine.

## Development

```bash
# Install deps locally (for gh-pages deployment)
# So I don't need to setup git inside the container)
npm ci

# To run locally
npm run docker:dev

# Deploy
npm run docker:build
npm run deploy
```
